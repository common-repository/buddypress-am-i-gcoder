A plugin I hacked to show off some skills when applying for WordPress GSoC 2010

== Description ==

The point was to create some simple (proof of concept) api, that I will be able to update
somewhere from outside making a POST/GET and the results to be shown in my activity.

== Installation ==

Download and upload the plugin to your plugins folder. Activate it!

== Notes ==

Do not use it in production!
